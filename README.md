- Column header - Each field was formated using the column header in order to help easily identify what each field is about and how it relates to other fields of data.
- Remove duplicate - Duplicates were removed by applying the remove duplicate tool on the home tab which reduced row from 200 to 199 after which serial numbers were adjusted to show the right amount of rows after removing duplicates
- Trim function - Trim function was used to remove all wrong spaces in each cell.
- Proper function - Proper function was used to make each text string in the field titled region begin with capital letters
- Concatenate - Text strings in fields named Column2 and Region2 were combined together to give complete name for each region using the Concantenate function.
- Past as value - After the afore mention steps have been taken, the final cleaned data for fields titled Region and sales method were copied and pasted as values in the right column on the table while the extra fields no longer needed were deleted.

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the sales performance of an apple product retailing company in the past year. By analysing various aspects of the sales data, we want to identify trends, gain depper understanding of the company's performance and make data driven recommendation. The process used in this analysis are broken into 3 major stages_ Data cleaning, exploratory analysis and data visualization using dashboard.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this project is the sales data in "data cleaning in Excel" file. The dataset contains detailed information about sales of different Apple products including sales method, unit cost, revenue, expenses and other important information. The dataset was initially dirty hence had to be cleaned to be fit for analysis and visualization.

### Excel Tools Used


Data cleaning tools:
- Table 
- Border tool 
- Column header 
- Remove duplicate  
- Trim function 
- Proper function 
- Concatenate 
- Past as value 
- Alignment tool

 Exploratory Analysis tool:
 - Pivot table

 Visualization tools:
 - Charts
 - Shapes
 - Slicer


 ### Data Cleaning/ Preparation
 
 
The firs step taken in this sales analysis project is data cleaning. This was done to remove any outliers, inconsistency and ensure data is ready and suitable for exploratory analysis and viusualization. The data cleaning was done with different data cleaning tools and in accordance to the steps written below:
- Table: All data in the spreadsheet were formatted as table using the table tool in order to make the data easy to manage and work wit
- Border tool: Borders were inserted into the table using the border tool in the home page in order to highlight data, improve visibility and separate one cell from another.
- Column header: Each field was formatted using the column header in order to help easily identify what each field is about and how it relates to other fields of data.
- Remove duplicate: Duplicates were removed by applying the remove duplicate tool on the home tab which reduced row from 200 to 199 after which serial numbers were adjusted to show the right amount of rows after removing duplicates
- Trim function: Trim function was used to remove all wrong spaces in each cell.
- Proper function: Proper function was used to make each text string in the field titled region begin with capital letters
- Concatenate: Text strings in fields labeled Column2 and Region2 were combined together to give complete name for each region using the Concatenate function.
- Past as value: After the afore mention steps have been taken, the final cleaned data for fields titled Region and sales method were copied and pasted as values in the right column on the table while the extra fields no longer needed were deleted.
- Alignment too: Finally all the cells were center aligned to make them uniform and attractive using the alignment tool in the home tab.

- ### Exploratory Data analysis

 EDA was done by using pivot table to explore the sales data to answer questions such as:
 1. What is the overall sales trend?

 3. Which regions has the highest and lowest sales?
 4. ![Sales by Region](https://github.com/NgoziGoodness/Data-Analysis-in-Excel/assets/164032971/8023d10f-f7da-405b-ba36-ae8c34b9f11f)

 5. Which product has the highest and lowest sales?
 6. ![Sales by Products](https://github.com/NgoziGoodness/Data-Analysis-in-Excel/assets/164032971/deeb9ee3-c256-4758-8949-4d6420114f69)

 7. Which sales method is more effective?
 8. ![Sales Method](https://github.com/NgoziGoodness/Data-Analysis-in-Excel/assets/164032971/e7ba430f-d74f-4862-a19e-d8c9d49dfe94)

 Pivot table was the major tool used to analyze the sales data. Each question was answered by inserting pivot table on a different page and analyzing after which the information gotten was displayed on charts.


### Visualization

All anlysis done were represented on different charts as outlined below
- Line chart for sales trend
- Bar charts for sales by region
- Column charts for sales by products
- Pie charts for sales method
After visualizing our analysis on different charts, I created dashboard to bring all the information represented on the different charts to one spot and to make the visualization dynamic.

(See uploaded file named "Exploratory data analysis on sales along with dashboard using Excel" file uploaded in repository for details)


  ### Results/Fndings

  The analysis reults are summerized as follows:

  1. The company's sales started on a good note in the first month after which sales became inconsistent with little to no improvement but gradually picked up in July with a noticable peak in the month of August followed 
      by gradual decline and inconsistency in sales with december recording the lowest sales for the year.
  2. Apac has the highest sales record while Emea has the lowest.
  3. Macbook is the highest selling product while Iwatch is the lowest selling product.
  4. In-store method is the most effective sales method.
 
     ### Recommendations

     Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
     - Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales period to maximise revenue.
     - Focus on expanding and promoting Macbooks and Iphones which are the top selling products.
     - Implement more instore method of selling and its the most effective method.
     - Invest more in the highest selling regions and implement trategies to duplicate the success in the highest selling region in the lowest selling region.
